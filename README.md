# MicroservicePOCJava
This code is samples of my learning process while attempting to migrate a Go microservice to Java

It was my first attempt at setting up a web client and server, and I have decided to keep the entire messy learning process on record.

My learning process here centred around:
- understanding build tools (Maven and Gradle)
- understanding and comparing web clients (each branch is a different client, I chose Apache's web client in the end)
- understanding the difference between a web client and server
- becoming familiar with Spring's different web annotations
- developing fluency in Go
